# ONNX Runtime Mobile Model Zoo

The ONNX Runtime Mobile Model Zoo is a collection of pre-trained, state-of-the-art models in the ONNX format that can be easily used and deployed in mobile applications. Each model grouped by specific tasks it accomplishes are written E2E in Jupyter notebooks for creating onnx model, adding pre/post processing support and deploying in mobile app, etc. The notebooks are written in Python and include links to the original model source.

## Tasks

### Audio
 - Speech-To-Text

### Natural Language Processing
 - [Question Answering](nlp/question_answering)
 - [Sentiment Analysis](nlp/sentiment_analysis/)


### Vision
-  Image Classification
-  [Object Detection](vision/object_detection)
-  [Super Resolution](vision/super_resolution)
