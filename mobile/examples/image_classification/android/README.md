# ONNX Runtime Mobile image classification Android sample application

## Overview
This is an example application for [ONNX Runtime](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime) on Android. The demo app uses image classification which is able to continuously classify the objects it sees from the device's camera in real-time and displays the most probable inference results on the screen.

This example is loosely based on [Google CodeLabs - Getting Started with CameraX](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/camerax-getting-started)

### Model
We use pre-trained [MobileNet V2 models](https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/main/vision/classification/mobilenet) from the ONNX model zoo in this sample app.

## Requirements
- Android Studio Electric Eel 2022.1.1+ (installed on Mac/Windows/Linux)
- Android device with a camera in [developer mode](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options) with USB debugging enabled

## Build And Run

### Step 1. Clone the ONNX Runtime Mobile examples source code and download required model files
Clone this GitHub repository to your computer to get the sample application.

Run `mobile/examples/image_classification/android/prepare_models.py` to download and prepare the labels file and model files in the sample application resource directory.

```bash
cd mobile/examples/image_classification/android  # cd to this directory
python -m pip install -r ./prepare_models.requirements.txt
python ./prepare_models.py --output_dir ./app/src/main/res/raw
```

Then open the sample application in Android Studio. To do this, open Android Studio and select `Open an existing project`, browse folders and open the folder `mobile/examples/image_classification/android/`.

Then Select `Run -> Run app` and this will prompt the app to be installed on your device.

Now you can test and try by opening the app `ort_image_classifier` on your device. The app may request your permission for using the camera.
